Click on the green icon that you just added and then choose a function call under the Write to contract title. There will be multiple Schedule Call functions, choose the first one, that only has three fields:

contractAddress will be the address of the deployed crowdsale contract.
abiSignature will be 0x01cb3b20. You can figure out the signature for any function by trying to execute them but in the confirmation window, instead of typing your password, copy the code in the Data field. The function signature is the first 10 characters in bold.
targetBlock is the block number in which you want the function to be executed, read below to calculate an estimation.
The crowdsale contract specifies a deadline using a timestamp, but the Alarm clock currently schedules calls based on block numbers. Since ethereum has a block time of approximately 17 seconds, we need to compute a block number that is going to be probabilistically past the deadline. We can do this with the formula current_block_number + duration_in_minutes * 60 / 17 + buffer where buffer is a number of blocks that is sufficiently large that you can rely on it occurring after the crowdsale deadline. For short crowdsales less than a day in duration a buffer of 200 blocks should be sufficient. For durations closer to 30 days, you should probably pick a number closer to 5,000.

You can use the following chart for rough estimates for how many blocks to add to the current block to compute the targetBlock.

1 hour duration (60 minutes): 212 blocks
1 day duration (1440 minutes): 5082 blocks
1 week duration (10,800 minutes): 38,117 blocks
1 month duration (44,640 minutes): 157,553 blocks
On the Send field, you need to send enough ether to pay the transaction fee, plus some more to pay the scheduler. Any extra money sent will be refunded, so sending at least 0.25 ether will probably keep you on the safe side.

After that, just press execute and your call will be scheduled. There are no guarantees that someone will actually execute it, so you should check back after the deadline has passed to be sure.//
